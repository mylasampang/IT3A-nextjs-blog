        I am Myla Manalastas Sampang. I am 20 years old and turning 21 this coming month of september. I am from San Jaun, San Luis Pampanga. I like playing/watching  volleyball, and I like to sing and dance even though Im not that totally good at it. 
        I have a twin sister and we are the eldest among our siblings. I take the IT course because I had a little bit of knowledge about technology and because it is indemand in todays time.
        A vision Ive always wanted for myself 10 years from now is to be a wealthy business woman working in a big company in a better position. And to be the best version of myself and do what I really like, 
        following my profession and making my family proud.
